        <h1>Generative Mindfulness</h1>
        <p>For my final year project I’m investigating the link between generative art and mindfulness/art therapy. Ahead are two toolkits for you to have a play around with. The first one will focus on mindful exercises while the second will give you some
            tools to create your own generative art. After you’ve finished you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire. In total, this should only take about 15 minutes. Please make sure that you use a laptop or computer for this. At the end of the
            second toolkit there will be a button to save data which will download a plain text file. Please do so so that you can upload it to the questionnaire once you’re done. It is also advised (but not necessary) that you find a calm environment
            free from distractions whilst you experiment with the toolkits. You need only follow the walkthrough section of each toolkit, however, a sandbox mode is provided if you wish to return to this website and use the toolkits in the future without
            direction. Click the button below to proceed and enjoy!</p>
