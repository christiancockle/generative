            <img src="./assets/bg1.jpg" alt="Flowfield" data-original="bg1.jpg" data-description="The flowfield toolkit is based on a very simple idea but can produce wonderfully complex results. Imagine there is a constant gust of wind being swept across the surface of the canvas. Now also imagine many tiny particles being blown around by this force and leaving a very faint trail as they travel. These trails build up over time to create images as seen on the left. Give it a try by clicking the arrow below."

            <img src="./assets/ch.jpg" alt="Chaos and Order" data-original="ch.jpg" data-description="Chaos and order is more of a toy to play with than a toolkit for generating art. A number of agents are placed randomly on the canvas and exhibit 1 of 2 behaviours. By default these agents travel in straight lines and only turn to avoid contact with one another. However, when the mouse is held down, these agents all target the position of the mouse and no longer attempt to avoid contact with one another. Have a play around with it below."

            <img src="./assets/chem.jpg" alt="Chemical Diffusion" data-original="chem.jpg" data-description="Chemical diffusion, more commonly referred to as reaction-diffusion, is slightly more complicated than the other tools but still relies on some basic rules. 2 chemicals are simulated, A and B, and both diffuse over time (A faster than B). More of A is gradually added over time, while B is gradually removed. When 1 particle of A is in the presence of 2 particles of B, it gets converted to a B. You can use the mouse to drop in chemical B needed to kickstart the reaction. Try below. (Warning: results can be very slow)."

            <img src="./assets/agg2.jpg" alt="Diffusion Limited Aggregation" data-original="agg2.jpg" data-description="Our final toolkit, diffusion limited aggregation, simulates many random ‘walkers’ who start at the edge of the canvas and move completely randomly. When they stumble into the centre root node or other parts of the tree, they freeze and become part of the tree themselves, aggregating to form these busy structures. Try below."
